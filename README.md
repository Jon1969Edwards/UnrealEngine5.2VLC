# 📺 VlcMedia Plugin for Unreal Engine

This plugin enables Unreal Engine to stream video content using VLC Media Player functionality. Designed for Blueprint-only projects, it includes everything you need to drop in and start playing streaming `.m3u8` sources with no source compilation required.

---

## ✅ Features

- Stream `.m3u8` and live video URLs in UE 5.4+
- Auto-play support via included `BP_TV` Blueprint
- Packaged plugin — no C++ compilation needed
- Integrates MediaPlayer, Texture, and Material setup automatically

---

## 📦 Installation

1. Download or clone the plugin into your project's `Plugins/` folder:

YourProject/
└── Plugins/

└── VlcMedia/


2. The directory should look like this after packaging:

Plugins/
└── VlcMedia/

├── Binaries/

├── Config/

├── Content/

│ ├── BP_TV.uasset

│ ├── YourMediaAssets...

├── Resources/

├── VlcMedia.uplugin

└── README.md


3. Open or restart your Unreal project.
4. Enable the plugin if it is not already auto-loaded.
5. Done! Ready to drag and drop the TV Blueprint into the world.

> ✅ **Note:** No need to build or compile C++ modules. This is a precompiled, packaged plugin.

## 🧠 Setup Guide

This setup follows [this tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nNNzUf3zNjM&t=2s) for Blueprint-based media playback using streaming URLs.

### 1. Included Blueprint: `BP_TV`

Drag the `BP_TV` Blueprint into your level. It auto-plays video on BeginPlay using an index from a predefined Media Source array.

#### 🔧 To customize:
- Open `BP_TV`
- Replace the default entries in the `ChannelList` array with your own `Stream Media Source` assets.
- Adjust the `ChannelIndex` integer variable to select which one auto-plays.

### 2. Blueprint Logic

The following Blueprint handles media loading and playback:

If the image above does not load, make sure the `docs/BP_TV_AutoPlay.png` file is in your GitHub repository.

## 📌 Notes

- If playback fails, check that:
- Your `.m3u8` or stream URL is public and working
- VLC is installed and supported (used under-the-hood)
- Media Source is properly assigned

- StreamMediaSources used in Blueprints must be stored in the main `Content/` folder (not inside the plugin) unless manually linked.

## 🧪 Example Streams (For Testing)

Use any of these publicly accessible streams:
- [NASA TV](https://nasatv-lh.akamaihd.net/i/NASA_101@319270/master.m3u8)
- [DW English](https://dwstream4-lh.akamaihd.net/i/dwstream4_live@123456/master.m3u8)

> ⚠️ Some streams may block cross-origin requests. Use trusted sources for production.
